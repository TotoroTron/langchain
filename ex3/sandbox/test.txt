prefix="The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. In this program, we'll generate Fibonacci numbers up to 250." imports='# No imports are necessary for this simple Fibonacci sequence generator.' code="def fibonacci_up_to(max_value):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a <= max_value:\n        print(a, end=' ')\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Call the function to print Fibonacci numbers up to 250\nfibonacci_up_to(250)"
